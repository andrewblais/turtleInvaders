## Created in completing an assignment for Angela Yu Course:

### **Day 94, Professional Portfolio Project [GUI Automation]**

#### **_Assignment 14: "Space Invaders"_**

Build the classic arcade game where you shoot down alien ships.

- _assignment
  for [Angela Yu 100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)_

### **Assignment instructions:**

Using Python Turtle, build the classic shoot 'em up game - space invaders game.

[Space Invaders Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)

Your space ship can move left and right and it can hit some alien ships. Every second the
aliens will move closer to your ship. Once the aliens touch your ship then it's game
over. There are usually some barriers between you and the aliens which offers you
defensive positions.

You can play the game here:
